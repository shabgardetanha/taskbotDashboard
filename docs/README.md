# Documentation

This repository's documentation has been consolidated under the `docs/` folder.

Primary landing pages:

- `docs/MIGRATIONS_INDEX.md` — Migration documentation index and quick-start
- `docs/migrations/MIGRATION_GUIDE_FA.md` — Detailed Farsi migration guide
- `docs/MIGRATIONS_CHECKLIST.md` — Execution checklist (English)
- `docs/MIGRATIONS_SUMMARY_FA.md` — Farsi summary of migrations
- `docs/MIGRATIONS_VISUAL_GUIDE.md` — Visual migration guide (English)
- `docs/SETUP_MIGRATIONS_FA.md` — Quick setup (Farsi)
- `docs/UPGRADE_ROADMAP.md` — Feature roadmap and phase plan

If you want a single quick command to start migration execution, run (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\VsProject\taskbotDashboard
supabase db push
```

If you'd like additional documentation pages (quick API examples, developer workflows, or a docs sidebar), tell me which pages to add and I'll create them.
